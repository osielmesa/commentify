## Relevants technologies and techniques
1. Typescript
2. React navigation
3. Redux toolkit: store, slices, redux dev tools, creatSlice, creatAsyncThunk...
4. Built-in hooks: useEffect, useState, useCallback, from redux (useDispatch, useSelector)...
5. Custom hooks: useFetch. Also, it allows to mock API calls.
6. UI framework: react-native-elements.
7. Async storage: to save data locally in the device.
8. FlatList: for better rendering and performance.

## Improvements
- [ ] All saved data in local storage is loaded at once when Home screen is loaded: this could be improved by loading only when data is requested.
- [ ] Saving data to local storage: At the moment the app is reading the requested data, inserting on it and then saving all data back. Maybe this could be improved.
- [ ] Horizontal scrolling: Sometime the horizontal scroll is not working properly.
- [ ] Top level comments rendering: The top level comments of an article are being rendered by .map, this will render all of them even when they are not visible on the screen.
- [ ] The UI can be improved to make it more beautiful and pixel perfect.
